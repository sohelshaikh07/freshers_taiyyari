#Code Explanation :-

The code is a function that takes an integer as input and displays the factors of that number.

The code starts by declaring variables for iNo, which is the number to be displayed, and i, which will start at 1 and increase until it reaches iNo.

The first line in the function is void DisplayFactors(int iNo) { This tells us what this function does: It displays all of the factors of a given integer.

This statement also declares two local variables called "i" and "i", which are used to store values while looping through each factor.

The code attempts to display the factors of a given number.
