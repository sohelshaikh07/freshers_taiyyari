#Code Explanation :-

The code is a function that takes an integer and returns true if the number is even, or false if it's odd.

The main() function calls checkEvenOdd with the input of 0 as its argument.

The return value from checkEvenOdd is then checked to see whether it was equal to TRUE or FALSE.

If bRet == TRUE, then printf("Given Number is Even") will be executed; otherwise, printf("Given Number is Odd") will be executed.

The code attempts to check whether the number entered by the user is even or odd.
