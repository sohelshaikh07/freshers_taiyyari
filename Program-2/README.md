#program2.c

#Code Explanation :-

The code is a program that calculates the sum of two integers.

The first integer is 10 and the second integer is 11.


The code starts by declaring two variables, No1 and No2, to be integers with values of 10 and 11 respectively.


Next, it declares an int variable called Ans which will hold the result of adding these two numbers together when the program runs.


Next, in main(), we have a statement that assigns 0 to Ans because this function doesn't return anything back to its caller (the computer).


Then we have another statement that prints out "Addition is :- 0" on screen so you can see what's happening in your program as it executes.


The code attempts to print the result of adding 10 and 11.

#program2-1.c


The code starts by declaring two integers, No1 and No2.

The first line of the main function declares a variable named Ans that will hold the result of adding these two numbers together.

The next line in the program asks for user input from the console with a printf statement.

After receiving this input, it is stored in a variable called No1 and then used to print out an instruction on how to enter another number using scanf().

This second number is then stored in a variable called No2 and printed out as well.

These two variables are then added together with an addition operator ( + ) which creates a new integer value that is assigned to Ans .

The code attempts to output the following: Enter first number : Enter second number : Addition is : 3

#program2-2.c




The code starts by declaring two variables, iNo1 and iNo2.


These are unsigned integers that will be used to store the values of the numbers entered by the user.


Next, a function named Addition is declared with an input parameter called "iValue1" and "iValue2".


The function takes these two values as inputs and returns an integer value back to the calling program.


The main() function then declares three more variables: iAns, which is set to 0; iNo1, which is set to 0; and iNo2, which is set to 0.


Then it calls a printf statement that prints out a message asking for input from the user on how many numbers they want added together (the first number entered in this case).

After reading in their answer from stdin using scanf(), it uses printf() again but this time with %d instead of \n so that it can print out what was just read in from stdin without having any newline characters at all.

It then enters into an infinite loop where each iteration through this loop reads another number into its respective variable (iAns) using scanf().

Once both numbers have been read in via scanf(), they
The code is a simple function which adds two numbers together and returns the result.
