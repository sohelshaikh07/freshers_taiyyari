#Code Explanation :-

In this Folder/Branch we are gonna learn loops,
How to write Loops.

#Program6-5.c

The code starts by declaring a variable n and initializing it to 0.

The code then asks the user for their input, which is stored in the variable n. Next, the program uses a for loop to iterate through each number from 1 to n. Each time through the loop, printf() is called with "Hello World" as its argument and appended after every iteration of the loop.
The main function starts by asking for an input from the user on how many times they want Hello World printed on screen using scanf().
This value is stored in a variable named n that will be used later in this function when calling Display().
The code prints "Hello World" n times on the screen.
